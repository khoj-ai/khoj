## Local Server Installation
### Using Pip
#### 1. Khoj Installation
```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

  <Tabs groupId="operating-systems" queryString="os">
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
    ```shell
# Get Khoj Code
git clone https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj && cd khoj

# Create, Activate Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# For MacOS or zsh users run this
pip install -e '.[dev]'
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    ```shell
# Get Khoj Code
git clone https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj && cd khoj

# Create, Activate Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Khoj for Development
pip install -e '.[dev]'
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
      ```shell
    # Get Khoj Code
git clone https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj && cd khoj

# Create, Activate Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Khoj for Development
pip install -e '.[dev]'
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

#### 2. Postgres Installation & Setup

Khoj uses the `pgvector` package to store embeddings of your index in a Postgres database. To use this, you need to have Postgres installed.

  <Tabs groupId="operating-systems" queryString="os">
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
Install [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/). This comes pre-installed with `pgvector` and relevant dependencies.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    1. Use the [recommended installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
    2. Follow instructions to [Install PgVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#windows) in case you need to manually install it. Windows support is experimental for pgvector currently, so we recommend using Docker. Refer to Windows Installation Notes below if there are errors.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    From [official instructions](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="source" label="From Source">
    1. Follow instructions to [Install Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
    2. Follow instructions to [Install PgVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#installation) in case you need to manually install it.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

##### Create the Khoj database

Make sure to update your environment variables to match your Postgres configuration if you're using a different name. The default values should work for most people. When prompted for a password, you can use the default password `postgres`, or configure it to your preference. Make sure to set the environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to the same value as the password you set here.

  <Tabs groupId="operating-systems" queryString="os">
    <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
    ```shell
createdb khoj -U postgres --password
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    ```shell
createdb -U postgres khoj --password
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
      ```shell
sudo -u postgres createdb khoj --password
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

#### 3. Build the front-end assets

```shell
cd src/interface/web/
yarn install
yarn export
```

You can optionally use `yarn dev` to start a development server for the front-end which will be available at http://localhost:3000. This is especially useful if you're making changes to the front-end code, but not necessary for running Khoj. Note that streaming does not work on the dev server due to how it is handled with SSR in Next.js.

Always run `yarn export` to test your front-end changes on http://localhost:42110 before creating a PR.

#### 4. Run
1. Start Khoj
   ```bash
   khoj -vv
   ```
2. Configure Khoj
   - **Via the Desktop application**: Add files, directories to index using the settings page of your desktop application. Click "Save" to immediately trigger indexing.

  Note: Wait after configuration for khoj to Load ML model, generate embeddings and expose API to query notes, images, documents etc specified in config YAML

#### Windows Installation Notes
1. Command `khoj` Not Recognized
    - Try reactivating the virtual environment and rerunning the `khoj` command.
    - If it still doesn't work repeat the installation process.
2. Python Package Missing
    - Use `pip install xxx` and try running the `khoj` command.
3. Command `createdb` Not Recognized
    - make sure path to postgres binaries is included in environment variables. It usually looks something like
    ```
    C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin
    ```
4. Connection Refused on port xxxx
    - Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file in the location where postgres was installed.
    - Edit the file to have **trust** as the method for user postgres, local, and host connections.
    - Below is an example:
```
host    all             postgres        127.0.0.1/32            trust
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
```
4. Errors with installing pgvector
    - Reinstall Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with:
      1. desktop development with c++ selected in workloads
      2. MSVC (C++ Build Tools), Windows 10/11 SDK, and C++/CLI support for build tools selected in individual components.
    - Open the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt as an Administrator
    - Follow the pgvector windows installation [instructions](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#windows) in this command prompt.

### Using Docker

Make sure you install the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

#### 1. Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj && cd khoj
```

#### 2. Configure

1. Update [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to use relevant environment variables.
2. Comment out the `image` line and uncomment the `build` line in the `server` service

#### 3. Run

This will start the Khoj server, and the database.

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 4. Upgrade

If you've made changes to the codebase, you'll need to rebuild the Docker image before running the container again.

```shell
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

## Update clients
In whichever clients you're using for testing, you'll need to update the server URL to point to your local server. By default, the local server URL should be `http://127.0.0.1:42110`.

## Validate
### Before Making Changes
1. Install Git Hooks for Validation
   ```shell
   ./scripts/dev_setup.sh
   ```
   - This ensures standard code formatting fixes and other checks run automatically on every commit and push
   - Note 1: If [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) didn't already get installed, [install it](https://pre-commit.com/#install) via `pip install pre-commit`
   - Note 2: To run the pre-commit changes manually, use `pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all` before creating PR

### Before Creating PR

:::tip[Note]
You should be in an active virtual environment for Khoj in order to run the unit tests and linter.
:::

1. Ensure that you have a [Github Issue](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj/issues) that can be linked to the PR. If not, create one. Make sure you've tagged one of the maintainers to the issue. This will ensure that the maintainers are notified of the PR and can review it. It's best discuss the code design on an existing issue or Discord thread before creating a PR. This helps get your PR merged faster.
1. Run unit tests.
   ```shell
   pytest
   ```
2. Run the linter.
   ```shell
   mypy
   ```
4. Think about how to add unit tests to verify the functionality you're adding in the PR. If you're not sure how to do this, ask for help in the Github issue or on Discord's `#contributors` channel.

### After Creating PR
1. Automated [validation workflows](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj/tree/master/.github/workflows) should run for every PR. Tag one of the maintainers in the PR to trigger it.

## Obsidian Plugin Development
### Plugin development setup
The core code for the Obsidian plugin is under `src/interface/obsidian`. The file `main.ts` is a good place to start.

1. In your CLI, go to the directory `src/interface/obsidian` in the Khoj repository.
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server. This will continually rebuild the plugin as you make changes to the code.
    - Your code changes will be outputted to a file called `main.js` in the `obsidian` directory.

### Loading your development plugin in Obsidian
1. Make sure you have the Khoj plugin installed in Obsidian. [See the plugin page](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Plugins/khoj).
1. Open Obsidian and go to your settings (gear icon in the bottom left corner)
2. Click on 'Community Plugins' in the left panel
3. Next to the 'Installed Plugins' heading, click on the folder icon to open the folder with the plugin's source code.
4. Open the `khoj` folder in the file explorer that opens. You'll see a file called `main.js` in this folder. To test your changes, replace this file with the `main.js` file that was generated by the development server in the previous section.

## Create Khoj Release (Only for Maintainers)
Follow the steps below to [release](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj/releases/) Khoj. This will create a stable release of Khoj on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/khoj/), [Melpa](https://stable.melpa.org/#%252Fkhoj) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id%253Dkhoj). It will also create desktop apps of Khoj and attach them to the latest release.

1. Create and tag release commit by running the bump_version script. The release commit sets version number in required metadata files.
  ```shell
  ./scripts/bump_version.sh -c "<release_version>"
  ```
2. Push commit and then the tag to trigger the release workflow to create Release with auto generated release notes.
  ```shell
  git push origin master  # push release commit to khoj repository
  git push origin <release_version>  # push release tag to khoj repository
  ```
3. [Optional] Update the Release Notes to highlight new features, fixes and updates
