# Automations

[Automations](https://app.khoj.dev/automations) are a powerful feature within Khoj to schedule repeated jobs for Khoj to do on your behalf. Automations allow you run your query automatically at a scheduled time and frequency. Khoj will send its research to you as an email.
You can ask Khoj to create custom newsletters, summarize news, notify you of world events etc.

Khoj uses your local time zone for scheduling. You can configure, share and delete your automations from the [automations page](https://app.khoj.dev/automations).

:::info[Self Hosting]
Self hosting users need to setup Resend and [Authentication](/advanced/authentication) setup to have Khoj send automation emails.
