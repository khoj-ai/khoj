# Task file: Spec: First class folder sync support

---

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-24

### Task Completed
- Added `LocalFolderConfig` and `LocalFolder` models (combined first two spec tasks)

### Key Decisions
- `LocalFolderConfig`: OneToOneField to KhojUser with `enabled` flag (per-user config)
- `LocalFolder`: ForeignKey to LocalFolderConfig with `path` (CharField max 1000) and `last_synced_at` (DateTimeField, nullable)
- Used `unique_together = ["config", "path"]` to prevent duplicate folder paths per user
- Followed existing patterns from GithubConfig/GithubRepoConfig models
- Both models inherit from DbBaseModel (includes created_at, updated_at)

### Files Changed
- src/khoj/database/models/__init__.py (added LocalFolderConfig and LocalFolder models)

### Notes
- Models added at end of file after UserMemory model
- Python syntax verified
- Next steps: Add database adapters for CRUD operations, then create migration
